# Minibot Docker Compose environment variables
#
# NOTE: Secrets are managed via the macOS Keychain, not this file.
# Use minibot-secrets.sh to set, get, and rotate secrets:
#
#   minibot-secrets.sh init          # First-time setup
#   minibot-secrets.sh set <KEY>     # Update a secret
#   minibot-secrets.sh list          # View stored keys
#
# Secrets are loaded into the shell environment on login by
# zshrc-additions.sh, and also by minibot-start.sh before starting
# Docker Compose.
#
# Required secrets (set via minibot-secrets.sh):
#   POSTGRES_PASSWORD       - PostgreSQL database password
#   REDIS_PASSWORD          - Redis authentication password
#   MONGO_PASSWORD          - MongoDB root authentication password
#   OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_PASSWORD - OpenClaw gateway authentication password
#
# You do NOT need a .env file. This example exists for reference only.
